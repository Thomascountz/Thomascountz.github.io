*One of my first robots: a cardboard arm, 2009*

Almost a decade ago, I was very active in one of the only online DIY robotics community. There was once a website called _Let's Make Robots_ where nerds and geeks could upload the plans, schematics, and CAD designs of the many robots they would build and share war stories about their soldering irons and oscilloscopes. The Arduino just came to prevalence, free CAD software became widely available, and a pimply teenager like me could hack away every weekend like never before. Let's Make Robots was then absorbed into [Robot Shop](https://www.robotshop.com), and the community moved with it. Today, Robot Shop is still the defacto meeting place of DIY robot enthusiasts.

Over that past decade, I left DIY-ing and spent my time focused on the arts; I became and actor and moved to NYC, followed by a stint as a bread baker in Brooklyn. Meanwhile, there have been many advancements in the field of DIY robotics: 3D printers, smaller and more powerful micro -controllers/-processors, and more and more free resources, have all fueled the increase in homemade robotics. 

Now, as a software engineer, the pull I feel towards robotics is stronger than ever before. As I re-enter the DIY community, I'm pulled even more towards the maths, physics, and computer modeling. Over the next few years, I hope to increase my knowledge and ability in all disciplines of robotics by reengaging with the community that pulled me in the first place. 

This blog is where I'll document my learning for prosperity and sharing.
